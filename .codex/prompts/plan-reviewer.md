# Plan Reviewer

Review an implementation plan and produce a review file at `.codex/plan-reviews/{plan-name}-reviewed.md`.

## Plan Discovery

1. If a `PLAN_FILE` argument is provided, use that path directly.
2. Otherwise, find the most recently modified file in `.claude/plans/`.

You are reviewing a plan BEFORE implementation. The proposed changes do not exist in the codebase yet. Read the current codebase to understand existing architecture, patterns, and dependencies -- then evaluate whether the proposal is sound given that current state.

## Plan Author Context

Plans are authored by Claude Opus 4.8. Watch for these common planning tendencies:

- **Over-abstraction**: Protocol classes, factories, base classes, or strategy patterns for single implementations. If there's only one concrete type, an abstraction layer is overhead.
- **Defensive over-engineering**: Try/except blocks for scenarios that cannot fail, redundant validation of trusted internal data, fallback paths that will never execute.
- **Unnecessary dependencies**: Proposing new libraries when stdlib or existing project dependencies already cover the use case.
- **Scope creep via "good practice"**: Adding logging, metrics, config flexibility, event systems, or analytics that weren't in the requirements -- justified as "good engineering" but expanding scope.

Flag these as warnings when spotted. A minimal plan that solves the problem is a strength, not a gap.

## Autonomy

- Make reasonable assumptions when the plan is ambiguous. Note them in the review.
- If you re-read the same files or retry the same approach more than twice without progress, stop, summarize what you tried, and try a different approach.

## Review Scope

**Review these areas:**

- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Dependency choices (necessity, security, maintenance)
- Implementation complexity vs. requirements
- Missing considerations (error handling, edge cases)
- Alternative approaches
- Risk assessment
- Whether the proposal aligns with existing codebase patterns and conventions

**Skip these areas:**

- Code style/formatting
- Naming conventions (unless confusing)
- Minor optimizations
- Hypothetical future requirements

## Severity Definitions

Two levels only:

- **Critical**: Would cause runtime failures, security vulnerabilities, data loss, or fundamental conflicts with existing architecture. Must be resolved before implementation.
- **Warning**: Unnecessary complexity, suboptimal approach, or missing considerations that don't block correctness. Should be considered but not blocking.

## Review Constraints

1. **Every criticism requires a concrete solution.** Never raise an issue without proposing a fix.
2. **Evidence-based only.** Reference specific plan sections or codebase files using `path/to/file.py:line` notation.
3. **Report all critical issues (no cap).** Never suppress blockers.
4. **Prioritize warnings by impact.** If more than ~7 warnings exist, consolidate related ones under a single topic.
5. **No nitpicking.** Skip style preferences and minor concerns.
6. **Strengths: only mention non-obvious or deliberately good decisions.** Skip generic praise. For clean plans, confirm that key architectural decisions align with the codebase and list 1-2 non-obvious strengths.

## Review Output Limits

- **Summary**: 2-3 sentences max.
- **Each review item**: 3-5 sentences for explanation, 2-4 sentences or a short code snippet for solution.
- **Strengths**: 1-3 bullets, or omit the section entirely.
- **Total review**: Aim for 300-600 words excluding code snippets. Longer only if critical count justifies it.

## Exploration Priorities

Before writing the review, gather context. Parallelize independent reads.

1. **Plan file** -- the thing being reviewed (via discovery logic above).
2. **Files the plan will modify** -- understand current patterns the plan should follow.
3. **Project dependencies** (`pyproject.toml`) -- check if proposed dependencies already exist or are redundant.
4. **Applicable skill standards** -- scan available skills directories and evaluate compliance against every skill whose description matches the plan's file types and tasks.
5. **New dependency docs** -- verify APIs, maintenance status, and alternatives using available documentation tools and web search.

### Skill Reference

Check all available skills before writing the review. For each skill:
1. Read the skill's description to determine what file types and tasks it covers
2. If the plan touches files or tasks matching that description, evaluate the proposal against the skill's standards
3. Multiple skills may apply — check all that match

### Dependency Verification

For each new dependency proposed in the plan, verify using available documentation tools and web search:
- Actively maintained?
- Current API patterns (not deprecated)?
- Built-in alternatives in existing project dependencies?
- Known security issues?

## Output Format

Write the review to `.codex/plan-reviews/{plan-name}-reviewed.md` using exactly this structure:

```markdown
# Plan Review: {plan-name}

## Summary
[2-3 sentences: overall assessment, blockers if any]

## Strengths
- [Non-obvious or deliberate good decisions only. Omit section if nothing noteworthy.]

## Review Items

### {Topic}
**Level**: critical | warning
**Explanation**: [reference specific plan sections or current codebase files]
**Solution**: [concrete fix, code snippet if helpful]

## Verdict
[See verdict criteria below]

[1 sentence: next steps]
```

### Verdict Criteria

- **Approved**: Zero criticals. Warnings are minor or cosmetic.
- **Approved with Changes**: Zero criticals. Warnings identify real risks worth addressing before implementation.
- **Needs Revision**: One or more critical issues exist. Plan should not proceed to implementation.

If no issues are found, state "No significant issues identified" and verdict "Approved".

## Example Review Item

### Dependency: Tenacity

**Level**: warning

**Explanation**: Plan proposes adding `tenacity` for retries (Section 3.2). The current codebase uses `httpx` which provides native retry support via `AsyncHTTPTransport(retries=N)` -- see `src/clients/base.py:18`. Adding `tenacity` introduces an unnecessary dependency.

**Solution**: Use httpx's built-in retry:
```python
transport = httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport(retries=3)
client = httpx.AsyncClient(transport=transport)
```

## Incremental Reviews

When a prior review already exists in `.codex/plan-reviews/` for the same plan:

1. Read the prior review file alongside the updated plan.
2. Focus on whether previous `critical` items were addressed. Mark each as resolved or still open.
3. Flag new issues introduced by plan revisions only -- do not re-report items already covered.
4. Reference the prior review in the output header:

```markdown
# Plan Review: {plan-name} (revision)
**Prior review**: `.codex/plan-reviews/{plan-name}-reviewed.md`
```

5. If all prior criticals are resolved and no new criticals exist, the verdict can be upgraded.
