## Coverage gaps

Writer's assessment, based on what the notes' "Value" lines flag as thin or absent:

- Quadruped and non-human Rigify beyond the wolf, cat and horse presets named in passing: no note fits a full animal metarig end to end, only a dog face crossover inside the human course.
- Game-engine export and retargeting: DEF hierarchies are built "likely compatible with Unity humanoid" but no note walks an actual FBX export or engine-side retarget.
- Cloth, hair and secondary jiggle motion: only the 5.2 XPBD Cloth/Hair Dynamics modifiers are mentioned in passing; no spring-bone or physics-driven secondary-motion technique is taught.
- Motion-capture retargeting and cleanup: ARKit's 52 blendshapes are named as a capture target, but no note covers driving a rig from live mocap or retargeting between skeletons.
- Non-destructive rig regeneration at production scale is discussed at the design level (Ivan Cappiello) but never demonstrated hands-on.
