# Retopology critique rubric

How the experts judge a retopo, turned into checks an agent runs on itself. Run the code checks first, then render the two review sheets and walk the visual list in order. Score each section 0 (fails), 1 (works with visible problems), 2 (clean), and report every 0 or 1 with its cause. Kaspar's own summary of what matters: "is it clean, is it all quads, does it subdivide well, do you capture all of your forms and details, is it easy to rig ... vertex count has very little to do with that" (Snow Live #4 [00:58:52]).

## 0. Setup for the review

```text
t   = R.topology_report(retopo, crease_attr="retopo_crease", hidden_group="hidden_ok")
f   = R.fidelity(retopo, sculpt, levels=2, target_mask=<region you meant to cover>)
ls  = R.loop_stats(retopo)
eye = R.loops_around(retopo, eye_center, eye_normal, max_radius=2.6 * eye_radius, corners=(inner, outer))
sheets: cage wire (front, right, threequarter, low) and the same views with a temporary
Subsurf level 2 in matcap; the sculpt in matcap from the same views for comparison.
```

## 7. Honesty of the report

State the method per part (planned, auto, carved, socketed tube), the numbers from sections 1 to 5, the two sheets, and what was not done to expert level (articulation handles, expression creases, pole routing). An auto-remesh sold as "animation-ready" fails this section regardless of its numbers.
