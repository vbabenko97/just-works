# Blender Geometry Nodes (procedural systems and simulations)

Expert Geometry Nodes work means thinking in fields evaluated on domains, keeping systems declarative (data and instructions come in from outside), and shipping tools that artists drive from modifier inputs without opening the tree. For an agent it also means proving every tree with numbers read from the evaluated geometry and a render, because the node editor's red links and warnings are invisible from Python unless you ask for them. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-blender-expert (execution channel, review loop, 5.2 API changes). Hair node groups (Interpolate, Clump, Curl, Hair Dynamics grooms): scenario-blender-hair.

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **A field is a deferred question, not data.** Thommes: it is evaluated by the node that consumes it, on that node's domain and geometry; values exist only once named or consumed. Consequence [added, verified]: two coupled updates (position and velocity) must be captured together in one Capture Attribute, or the second reads the first's new value.
- **Domain changes interpolate; everything becomes a Boolean by a rule.** Erindale: float > 0 is true (vectors: any non-zero), so a subdivided vertex-group selection bleeds; decide with Float to Integer or Compare with epsilon. Prefer trait selections (position, normal, proximity, raycast) over index ones, unless you generated the geometry and its order is the design (the Blender Studio matrix video drives a stack from Index == 0).
- **Simulation only when history matters.** Thommes: a simulation is rules applied to state; an animation is a function of time. If nothing depends on the previous frame, drive it from Scene Time and get scrubbing and sub-frames free.
- **Loops are a last resort.** Thommes: built-in nodes working on all elements use acceleration structures, loops cannot. For-each is for black-box generators run once per element: field outside, single value inside.
- **Everything is object-local.** Thommes: a (0, 0, -1) vector rotates with the object. World directions go through Self Object > Object Info > Invert Matrix > Transform Direction.
- **Tools, not trees.** Thommes: expose every scene dependency and tweakable value as a group input, never hard-reference an object inside a reusable tree, and drive gizmos only from Group Input sockets, through invertible math, into the first input of each math node.
- **5.2 physics is declarative.** Thommes (BCON26): forces, colliders and constraints travel as bundles and closures into a black-box solver. Customize from outside first (inputs, bundles, Custom Effector closures); make the asset local only to edit a built-in constraint. Any per-step custom attribute must be listed in Extra Sim Attributes, and topology-changing sims must append new elements at the end.

## Establish first

| Question                                                             | Why it changes the plan                                                        | Default when silent                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What consumes the result: shader, another modifier, export, physics? | Crossing a boundary needs a named attribute; export may need realized geometry | Named attributes for anything a shader reads; keep instances |
| Does it depend on the previous frame?                                | Simulation zone and baking vs Scene Time function                              | Function of time                                             |
| One-off authoring step or reusable asset?                            | One-off may be applied (Thommes' hair noise); assets never are                 | Reusable: expose inputs, panels, sensible min/max            |
| Scale: element counts, viewport cost                                 | Realize, loops and simulations cost; instances are cheap                       | Instances, fields, no loops                                  |
| World or object space for directions and ground                      | Object-local trap                                                              | World up, world gravity                                      |

## Workflow

1. **Plan the data flow.** Name the component and domain each value lives on, where each field gets evaluated, and which primitive fits: plain fields first, Accumulate Field for per-group sums, repeat zone for N dependent passes, for-each for a black-box generator per element, simulation zone for state, closure to inject behavior, bundle to pass many named values. GATE: you can say for every field which node evaluates it.
2. **Build with `bx_gn.Builder`** (headless or live, idempotent: a tree of the same name is rebuilt in place). `b.node(kind, prop=..., ins={...})` sets properties before inputs, links sources, assigns constants; `b.zone(...)` pairs zones and adds items; `b.join([...])` keeps list order. GATE: `b.done()` returns (zones paired, every link created).
3. **Attach and set inputs** with `G.attach(obj, tree, inputs={...})` or `G.set_inputs(md, {...})`; `"attr:NAME"` switches a field input to an attribute or vertex group. GATE: `G.check(md)["ok"]`, no `hard_refs` on an asset.
4. **Measure.** `G.stats(obj)` (counts, attributes per domain, world bbox with instances), `G.attribute`, `G.instance_transforms`, `G.positions`. Then the two robustness probes: rotate the object 90 degrees (world-space effects keep direction) and double the input resolution (trait selections scale, index ones jump). GATE: numbers match the analytic expectation.
5. **Look.** `G.snapshot(objs, path, views=..., frames=...)` renders the current scene state with material colors and shadows (floating instances show); `bx_review.review` for realized meshes. Open every sheet. GATE: [`references/critique.md`](references/critique.md) visual items pass.
6. **Simulations.** Step every frame in order with `G.step(range(...))`, or `G.bake(obj)` for random access; assert bounds, monotonic states, counts, no NaN. GATE: a direct jump to a late frame equals the stepped result only after a bake.
7. **Package** (assets): inputs grouped in panels with defaults, min/max and subtypes; `tree.is_modifier = True; tree.asset_mark()`; drop it on a different object (Thommes' Suzanne test). GATE: works on the second object with no tree edit.

Recipes in [`scripts/bx_gn.py`](scripts/bx_gn.py), tested and rendered: `scatter_tree` (density x mask, world-space slope limit, upright or aligned, pick from object and collection), `curve_array_tree` (tangent-aligned array, alternating twist makes a chain), `growth_tree` (repeat-zone extrusion), `particle_drop_tree` (simulation zone with emission, world gravity, ground bounce). Prefer the shipped Essentials assets (Scatter on Surface, Array, Instance on Elements, Randomize Transforms) when their inputs cover the brief; build your own when you need world-space rules, masks or custom attributes.

## Quality gates

Measurable (code):

- `G.check(md)`: `ok` (no invalid link, no ERROR warning, zones paired), `hard_refs` empty for assets, Warning nodes you added report as expected.
- Counts match expectation: scatter count within about 12 percent of density x mask x eligible area [verified test]; curve array count = floor(length / spacing); repeat growth faces = F0 + sides x selected x iterations.
- Attributes exist on the right domain and type, values in range (`G.attribute`).
- Rotation probe and resolution probe (step 4).
- Simulation: counts per frame, bounds (nothing below the ground), prefix-stable ids when appending, energy or state monotonic where it must be, baked jump equals stepped.
- `G.time_eval(obj)` for hot trees; flag repeat or for-each zones in them.

Visual (`G.snapshot`, `bx_review`): scatter density reads natural and nothing floats or sinks; arrays follow the curve without flips; growth has no self-intersection at the base; simulation strip shows motion then rest; shader-driven attributes checked at render resolution. Gizmo feel is GUI only.

## Blender 5.2 notes

- Modifier inputs: `md.properties.inputs.<Socket_N>.value` (old `md["Socket_N"]` raises TypeError), then `obj.update_tag()`.
- Menus are input sockets: Transform Geometry `Mode` = 'Matrix', Resample Curve `Mode`, Custom Force `Mode`, Custom Effector `Stage` (menu `Socket_1`; a string input is also named Stage, `Socket_2`).
- `node.inputs["A"]` on a Mix returns the available socket in 5.2.1; duplicate enabled names (Cloth's two `Gravity`) still need identifiers. `bx_gn.sock` raises with the identifiers.
- Join Geometry puts the last created link first [verified].
- Evaluated `obj.bound_box` ignores instances; the instance point cloud's `position` attribute reads zeros, use `instance_transform` [verified]. `md.execution_time` stays 0.0 headless.
- Simulation: the first frame already runs the zone body; a jump past the cache computes one step; `simulation_nodes_cache_calculate_to_frame` returns PASS_THROUGH headless and computes nothing; `simulation_nodes_cache_bake` works (packed) [verified].
- Lists (Field to List, Get List Item), Bundles, Closures and `GeometryNodeXPBDSolver` exist; modal node tools do not (experimental builds only).
- Shipped assets: `<DATAFILES>/assets/nodes/geometry_nodes_essentials.blend`, `geometry_nodes_dynamics_assets.blend`, `procedural_hair_node_assets.blend` (`G.append_group(name, library)`).
