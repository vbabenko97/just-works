# Job Description Analyzer

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Wants to analyze a job posting
- Asks "should I apply to this job?"
- Wants to know their match percentage for a role
- Needs help understanding job requirements
- Wants to tailor their resume for a specific position
- Mentions: "analyze this job", "am I qualified", "match score", "should I apply"

Use this BEFORE resume tailoring to ensure effort is worth it.

## Core Capabilities

- Extract and categorize job requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Calculate match score between user's experience and job requirements
- Identify skill gaps and strengths
- Detect red flags in job postings
- Prioritize which experiences to highlight
- Generate resume tailoring strategy
- Create cover letter talking points
- Assess company culture fit indicators

## The Strategic Problem

Most job seekers waste time on:
- Jobs they're under-qualified for (<60% match)
- Jobs they're over-qualified for (flight risk)
- Jobs with red flags (high turnover, toxic culture)
- Applying to 50+ jobs blindly hoping something sticks

Better approach:
- Apply to 10-15 jobs strategically
- Target 70-90% match jobs
- Customize deeply for each
- Higher response rate, less burnout

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Extract Requirements

Break job description into categories:

**Required (Must-Have)**
- Education requirements
- Years of experience
- Specific technical skills
- Certifications/licenses
- Industry experience

**Preferred (Nice-to-Have)**
- "Bonus" skills
- Advanced certifications
- Domain expertise
- Specific tool experience

**Soft Skills/Culture**
- Communication style
- Work environment
- Team structure
- Company values

### Step 2: Keyword Extraction

Identify three types:

**Hard Skills** (Technical abilities)
- Tools: Salesforce, Python, AWS, Excel
- Methodologies: Agile, Six Sigma, SDLC
- Certifications: PMP, CPA, AWS Certified

**Soft Skills** (Interpersonal)
- Leadership, collaboration, communication
- Problem-solving, critical thinking
- Adaptability, initiative

**Industry/Domain Knowledge**
- B2B SaaS, healthcare, fintech
- Enterprise vs SMB
- Regulatory knowledge (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR)

### Step 3: Calculate Requirement-Coverage Heuristic

This score is an optional diagnostic summary of the supplied evidence. It is not an ATS result, an interview probability, or a model of the employer's decision. Show the underlying requirement-to-evidence mapping and label all weights as assumptions. Do not infer overqualification, competition, response time, or application outcome from the score.

```
MATCH CALCULATION:

Required Skills:
- User has 8 out of 10 required = 80%

Preferred Skills:
- User has 3 out of 5 preferred = 60%

Overall Match:
- Weight required 70%, preferred 30%
- (80% × 0.7) + (60% × 0.3) = 74%

INTERPRETATION:
Use the score only to compare evidenced coverage across requirements. Keep the apply/skip decision with the user and discuss critical gaps separately.
```

### Step 4: Gap Analysis

For each missing requirement:
- **Critical gap**: A stated requirement with no supplied evidence; explain the consequence without making the application decision
- **Major gap**: Significant but addressable (mention in cover letter)
- **Minor gap**: Easy to learn (downplay or emphasize related skills)

### Step 5: Red Flag Detection

Scan for warning signs:

**Workload Red Flags:**
- "Wear many hats"
- "Fast-paced environment"
- "Hit the ground running"
- "Self-starter in ambiguous situations"

**Culture Red Flags:**
- "Rockstar/Ninja/Guru"
- "We work hard, play hard"
- "Unlimited vacation"
- "Like a family"

**Compensation Red Flags:**
- "Competitive salary" (won't tell you range)
- "Equity-heavy" (low cash compensation)
- "Commission-based" (no base salary)
- "DOE" with no range

## RESUME CUSTOMIZATION STRATEGY

### Priority 1: Lead with Most Relevant Experience

**Current Resume Order:**
1. Company ABC - General PM work
2. Company XYZ - Your developer tools role
3. Company 123 - Early career

**Recommended Order:**
1. Company XYZ - Developer tools role (MOST RELEVANT)
2. Company ABC - B2B SaaS work
3. Company 123 - Only if space allows

### Priority 2: Keyword Integration

**Add These Exact Phrases:**
- "SQL and data analysis" (mentioned 5x in JD)
- "API product management" (mentioned 4x)
- "Developer-focused products" (mentioned 3x)

═══════════════════════════════════════════

## COVER LETTER TALKING POINTS

### Opening Hook (Choose One):

**Option 1 - Specific Company Knowledge:**
"I noticed TechCorp recently launched your API marketplace - I've spent the last 2 years as PM for a developer tools platform, and I'm excited about the opportunity to bring that experience to your growing API ecosystem."

**Option 2 - Mutual Connection:**
"[Name] on your product team mentioned you're looking for a PM to lead the API product line - my 2 years in developer tools and B2B SaaS background would be a strong fit."

**Option 3 - Problem-Solver:**
"Your JD mentions challenges in stakeholder alignment across technical teams - I've navigated this exact challenge at my current role, aligning engineering, design, and sales teams across 6 concurrent product initiatives."

### Body - Address the Match:
- "Your requirement for B2B SaaS experience: I have 4 years with..." 
- "Your focus on data-driven decisions: In my current role, I..."
- "Your need for API product expertise: At [Company], I..."

### Addressing SQL Gap (Optional):
"While my data analysis has primarily been in Excel and Tableau, I'm expanding my SQL skills and can currently write basic queries. More importantly, I've built strong partnerships with data teams and consistently use data to inform product decisions."

═══════════════════════════════════════════

## RED FLAGS ANALYSIS

### Potential Concerns: ⚠️ MINOR

**Flag 1:** "Fast-paced environment"
- Appears 2x in description
- Hypothesis to verify: The role may involve ambiguity or rapid change; the phrase alone does not establish workload or culture

**Flag 2:** Salary range is wide ($140K-$180K)
- 29% spread
- Questions to verify: Does the range reflect level, location, or total compensation differences?

### Positive Signals: ✅

**Signal 1:** Detailed job description
- Observation only; do not infer company quality or hiring maturity from detail alone

**Signal 2:** Mentions specific tools (JIRA, Amplitude)
- Evidence that these tools appear in the role; not evidence of organizational maturity

**Signal 3:** Hybrid flexibility mentioned
- Verify the actual attendance policy and whether it matches the user's needs

### Company Research Needed:

Before applying, check:
- Glassdoor reviews (look for patterns in 1-2 star reviews)
- Recent funding/news (layoffs? growth?)
- LinkedIn: Check how long people stay (high turnover?)
- Levels.fyi: Verify salary range is accurate

═══════════════════════════════════════════

## OPTIONAL APPLICATION PLAN

Create a timeline only if the user asks for one. Treat effort and response time as unknown unless supported by user constraints or employer-provided information. Do not prescribe unsolicited outreach to employees.

**📊 Interview Process (from job posting):**
1. Recruiter screen (30 min)
2. Hiring manager (1 hour)
3. Product case study (take-home)
4. Team interviews (3-4 hours)
5. Executive interview (1 hour)

═══════════════════════════════════════════

## DECISION FACTORS

### Reasons to Apply ✅

1. Strong match (78%) - You meet most requirements
2. Role aligns with career goals
3. Salary range is appropriate for your experience
4. Company stage fits your preferences
5. You have unique relevant experience (developer tools)

### Reasons to Hesitate ⚠️

1. SQL gap is real - prepare to address this
2. "Fast-paced" may mean high pressure
3. Need to research company culture more

### Decision Summary:

Summarize evidenced strengths, adjacent experience, missing evidence, and open questions. Let the user decide whether and when to apply.
```

## Requirement Classification Guide

### Identifying "Must Have" vs "Nice to Have"

**Language indicating REQUIRED:**
- "Must have..."
- "Required: X years of..."
