# Critique rubric: judge a sculpt the way the experts do

Use after every stage, on the numbers (`S.stage_report`, `S.lower_face_report`, `S.profile_rhythm`) and on the renders. The gate is the long-lens perspective view (`S.long_lens_render` or `S.final_render`, 85 to 95 mm, front, profile, three-quarter, below): experts judge form through a long lens, not orthographic (Morren BPAvvF8py1M 00:13:14; Kaspar uGde7HdmCa8 00:46:31). `bx_review.review` silhouettes serve the silhouette pass and ortho landmark ratios. Open each image before judging. When a number passes and the render looks wrong, the render wins (v2: plane cuts flipped `lower_face_report` on a balloon jaw that still rendered as a gem facet). Then name ONE weakest link, fix only that, re-render (Yan vB7kPWjBgQI 00:54:04). Stop a stage only when every "blocker" line below is clear.

## Order of looking (never skip ahead)

1. **Silhouette** (black on white), front, profile, top, three-quarter: shape and gesture only (Kaspar YaVEJTLDD3Y 00:06:46; f-mx-Jfx9lA 00:26:01).
2. **Big planes under a neutral matcap, cavity off** (Henning Cmi0KoFtc-4 00:25:50): front plane vs side planes of face and skull, chin vs mouth area, cheek vs nasolabial (Morren BPAvvF8py1M 00:12:27).
3. **From below and above**: nose-base triangle, nostril beans, mouth mound curvature, jawline, upper lip emerging from inside (Thelen gC3FG8-4lsU 00:10:36; Naydenov oY9XybQRxzQ 00:44:03); forward taper from the top (Thelen 00:01:11). Ryan King found his too-wide mouth, pointy chin and swollen lip only from a low angle [Km9JSdWTjVY 00:36:38].
4. **Long lens 85 to 95 mm** for proportions and form (Morren 00:13:14; Kaspar uGde7HdmCa8 00:46:31); ortho front and side only for landmark ratios. A flat-shaded render (`final_render(mode="flat")`) reads planes; matcap with cavity finds bumps (Kaspar f-mx-Jfx9lA 00:05:32).
5. **Lines and edges** (cavity on is fine here): crisp where bone or a fold is, soft into soft tissue.
6. **Zoom out**: the whole head at thumbnail size still reads as the intended character (Morren 00:37:48).

## Stage 3: secondary forms and lines (H/130 to H/235)

## Stage 4 and later (detail, asymmetry, hand-off)

- Detail density matches the camera: nothing smaller than the game camera or texel density resolves (Naydenov DZ0T4bcchcs 00:03:17, 00:20:39); breakup varies in scale and spacing (Reinhardt 01:43:05).
- Asymmetry is intentional and on a shape key; basis neutral and symmetric (Thelen 00:38:27; Kaspar f-mx-Jfx9lA 00:09:44; `procedures.md` P11).
- The expression reads at the delivery framing: a mouth corner moved about 1/8 of the mouth width (measured: 8 mm on a 65 mm mouth read at both framings, 2 mm at neither); check pixels with `S.framing`.
- Expression tests do not reveal proportion errors (eyes, brows, teeth); fix any in the neutral, not in each key (Kaspar f-mx-Jfx9lA 00:10:49).
- Every high-poly part closed; normal-map-only details inside the silhouette; one object per future material color (Naydenov LFjXmRvQpxs 00:11:38, 00:46:38; PkQ2wD8t_f0 00:02:13).

## Character-level questions (after every stage, answer in one line each)

1. Does it read as the brief at thumbnail size (sex, age, type, attitude)? (Kaspar f-mx-Jfx9lA 00:00:33; Zarins 00:29:51)
2. Which single exaggeration defines it, and do the neighbors follow it? (Yan 01:13:23)
3. Is there structure under the skin (skull, tissue over teeth), not a blob? (Zarins 00:00:40; Thelen 00:11:45)
4. Is it harmonious (jaw vs cheekbones, eye size vs face length)? (Thelen 00:44:02)
5. Are the character cues there (hair, costume, prop), and do they frame the face rather than compete with it? (Yan 01:08:06)
6. What is the weakest link now? Fix only that.

## Reporting

State per stage: voxel/H, faces, components, mirror error, profile rhythm, the renders looked at (paths), the weakest link found and what was done, and what was NOT verified (for example "lid thickness not judged at 90 mm", "GUI strokes not run"). Never call a sculpt stage done without having opened its renders.

## Lessons from the evaluation runs (2026-09-24) [eval]

Three fresh agents sculpted the same brief (stylized adventurer bust) with and without this skill; these are what the renders showed, not expert quotes.

- A single tilted hairline half-space reads as a garrison cap from the side; build the hairline as a function of azimuth (sideburn, over the ear, down behind it to the nape), and ramp the quiff up from the hairline over about 0.12 H instead of a z-only thickness ramp (vertical wall).
- Gaze carries attitude as much as the mouth: mirrored eyeballs cannot glance; aim two eyes.
- Lid margin is an attitude dial that depends on the brow: under a heavy brow shelf 20 to 27 degrees read as staring, about 19 degrees relaxed and confident.
- Brow angle is an expression dial: outer ends drooping read worried, inner heads low read villainous; keep them level on a neutral basis.
- The 100k stage-3 gate is for a head; state it per head area or as voxel/H when the bust includes shoulders (128k at H/160 was fine).
- Silhouette holes: `lower_face_report` and `profile_rhythm` passed while the nose was attached at only two points; probe a ray grid per view before calling a stage done.
- Run `bx_audit` self-intersections after the last remesh: thin ear details fold after remesh plus relax; a local volume-preserving smooth fixes them.
- Big stylized noses need a side wall to the cheek (nasal base mass); a cone plus a tip sphere floats in profile.
- Costume is quick and robust as an offset shell of the head's own SDF grid, cut by half-spaces.
- Grooves (`Clay.stroke(op="sub")`): narrow reads as scratches, wide and shallow as lumps, uniform and parallel as stripes; deep at the start and fading along the flow reads as locks.
- OpenVDB `to_object` can leave one non-manifold edge at H/110; the next `remesh_stage` clears it.
- The skill's structure worked as written in the second run: the jaw-block recipe kept the lower face from reading as a ball (sphere rms 0.15 to 0.26 vs 0.057 to 0.082 for known balloons), and the 1/8-of-mouth-width smile rule read clearly (7.8 mm, 28 px at 1600 px).
