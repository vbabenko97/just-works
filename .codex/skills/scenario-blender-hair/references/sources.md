Five videos were distilled into this skill. Notes and transcripts are in the project folder: `notes/hair/<id> - <title>.md`, the batch digest `notes/hair/_digest_hair.md`, and `transcripts/<id>.txt` (auto captions). None had frame grabs, so visual details come from speech. The Blender versions on screen were 3.5 to about 4.5. `procedures.md` and the **5.2** marks in `expert-notes.md` record what changed in 5.2.1.
