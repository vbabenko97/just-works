# Critique rubric: judging a previs like the experts

Use it at every Look gate: open the contact sheet (and the floor plan, the A/B sheet, frames pulled from the MP4), run `P.audit`, then go through the list. Each item is pass, or a named fix. Report what could not be judged (comic timing with sound, mood with a human audience).

## 1. Beats and structure (Hjalti)

- Every fact of the script is a numbered beat, one fact per line; every added beat is marked and justified. Measurable: `P.shot_list` accepted the grouping.
- Every beat is visible in some thumbnail. Put the beats list next to the contact sheet and tick them. A beat that exists only in the intent text is missing.
- Logistics hold: the distances characters cover fit the time the edit gives them (Jay cannot cross the room in 10 frames). An oversimplified version is too short by construction.
- Props read instantly (a snack reads as a snack from this camera; the sprinkle shaker did not).

## 2. Treatment and length (Hjalti)

- A theater version exists (or a reason for skipping it) and was judged for acting before cameras.
- Runtime is budgeted: cinematic about 2x theater, up to 3x; about 1.6 to 1.9 s per beat for a first cinematic cut [derived]. Too long means gags over-milked; too short means beats missing.
- Only the camera moves that carry meaning are animated; every other shot is one still. Measurable: `audit` flags a camera moving inside a still shot and keys between block starts outside live shots.
- Cost: Workbench grays, no mood lighting (a non-Workbench engine is an audit problem, lights a warning); mannequins unless the brief asks for Rigify (then `ensure_rigify` first).

## 3. Each shot

- **Intent written** for the shot (what the audience must feel or learn), and the camera choice follows from it. A non-eye-height camera without an intent is an audit problem.
- **Size fits the beat:** measured size (`size_measured`) close to the plan; the hero readable at thumbnail size. The robot at 0.55 m covered 0.15 of the frame height in the S6 wide: fine for a return-to-neutral, too small for a reveal.
- **One thing to look at** after the cut (Hjalti). Two comparable subjects in a reveal: restage one in front of the other.
- **Nothing blocks the hero:** audit `eye_visible` and `blockers`, then look (the ray only tests two points).
- **Extremes contained** in a locked-off frame: tallest pose, entrance path, widest travel (audit head/feet in frame over every block).
- **Cheats invisible:** no hovering feet, clipped props or giant furniture in frame; the neighboring shots unchanged (the cheat was keyed).
- **Pose readable from this camera:** a pose built from the front can vanish from a high angle (S6: arms forward hidden behind the head; arms out to the sides read).

## 4. Camera language and mood (Dillon, Hjalti)

- Neutral grammar where nothing is meant: eye level, medium lens, centered, static.
- Each statement matches the table in SKILL.md (low = hidden observer, top = pressure, dolly zoom = loss of control, long lens = informational or isolating, wide from far plus zoom = watched).
- A move ends on the intended subject (a tilt that ends on a cherry makes the cherry the subject).
- The emotional read survives the angle (Hjalti refused a side cut that turned menace into a silhouette).
- Mood survives each transition: no cut out of the space when tension is wanted; no two inanimate inserts in a row (audit flags the second).

## 5. Continuity

- One side of the action line for every camera that sees both subjects; POVs just off the line on the camera side (audit `side`).
- Over-the-shoulder on the shoulder the camera already occupies (Dillon).
- Screen direction per journey, reversed only when the character reverses (Charge; audit `travel`, per-shot override for a return).
- A jump cut in the same framing is a choice (elided routine time), not an accident.

## 6. Readability

- Grays, one pop color for the hero; opaque passepartout on every shot camera (audit), nothing outside the frame counts.
- Silhouettes separate from the background (Workbench outlines on). Where characters and set share a value, `fog_for_shot` behind the subjects; `values_at` hero vs backdrop before and after; the fog must not sit in front of the hero (the audit names it as a blocker) nor show in other shots.
- Stamped thumbnails legible: shot, lens, height class, size, seconds, intent.

## 7. Edit and timing

- The edit plays the shots in beat order; frames pulled from the MP4 match the cut list; burn-in version and clean version both rendered.
- Holds carry the joke (a freeze needs a hold); pushes and live shots land where the beat is.
- Sound, when used, sits on the beat frame; the length after sound is checked again (sound adds beats, Hjalti).
- Edit scene view transform equals the stills' (Standard), or the animatic drifts from the stills.
- A continuous action covered from several angles is a coverage run (one scene strip, soft cuts, a camera per piece); retime it with `retime_cut`, and the markers follow.

## 8. Hybrid boards (Spitfire, Renato, BouncyBrain)

- Drawings sit on the floor at contacts and read from the chosen camera.
- No carrier turns a flat drawing past about 70 degrees from the camera (`facing_report`) unless a redraw is planned.
- Parallax from separated planes reads; world effects stay in world space, only the followed hero rides the glass.

## 9. Honesty of the delivery

- The report states what was measured, what was looked at, what was cheated, and what remains a human call (comic timing, sound, performance nuance).
- Nothing overwritten: versioned stills, contact sheets, MP4s, scene pairs.

## What the numbers cannot judge

Whether it is funny, whether the mood lands on a human audience, whether a gag is milked too long, whether the performance is right. The agent can prepare the evidence (contact sheet, animatic, beat-aligned sound) but must say these are open.

## Worked example: S6 ("tired shopkeeper, robot steals a snack, freezes like a toy")

Built by `tests/code/blender-previs-storyboard/test_01_s6_end_to_end.py`. 15 beats (two added and marked), a theater pass (10 blocks, one 35 mm camera at 1.03 m, the mean of the two eye heights, 11.8 s) and a cinematic cut (11 shots, 24.5 s = 2.1x the theater pass, 1.63 s per beat).

Lesson: the audit found the continuity errors; only the pictures found the occlusions, the cut-off and the unreadable poses. Look at every sheet.
