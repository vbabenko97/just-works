# Critique rubric: judging a groom like the experts

Use this after every stage:

1. Run `H.groom_report(hair)` and `H.verdict(...)`.
2. Render `H.review([surface, hair], out, engine, views=...)`.
3. Open the sheet with the image reader.
4. Mark each line **OK** or **FIX**.

A FIX marked **B** (blocker) stops the next stage. **P** (polish) can wait for the polish pass. Never deliver without a full-density render; the viewport at 4% hides most of these (Thommes `[00:19:32]`).

## A. Attachment and setup (code)

| Check                                                   | How                                                                       | Sev | Source                                         |

## B. Guides (render the guides alone with a thick Profile, or Workbench)

| Gradual lengths                                           | `length_outliers == 0`; no short patch among long guides      | B   | Schmidbauer `[00:36:05]`                       |
| No guide inside thin geometry (ears) or crossing the part | pose-free render from 3 views; part-side roots comb away      | B   | Schmidbauer `[00:41:56]`, Bystedt `[00:02:53]` |

## C. Density and coverage (full-density render, rest pose)

| Check                      | Look for                                                                       | Sev | Source                             |

## D. Variation: Thommes' first-render critique plus Schmidbauer's "never straight"

| Check                               | Look for                                                                                 | Sev | Source                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Clumps not uniform                  | identical clump sizes or spacing: add a second clump layer (Guide Mask) and Clump Offset | P   | Thommes `[00:19:32]`, `[00:31:01]`             |
| Strays between clumps               | a few runaway hairs (about 10% of curves)                                                | P   | Thommes `[00:29:54]`                           |

| Clumps readable but not "too crazy" | A/B the clump layer; use Tip Spread and Clump Offset if needed                           | P   | Schmidbauer `[00:30:18]`, Bystedt `[00:21:31]` |

## E. Subject-specific

**Animals (Schmidbauer)**

- Likeness: landmark regions (ruff, chest, back, tail fan) read as in the reference of the same subspecies and season `[00:03:24]`, `[00:07:36]`. Sev B.
- Each region has its own character (cheeks clumpy, chest straight), set by masks `[00:28:35]`. Sev P.
- Seams between landmark objects: no density jump and no clipping `[00:13:49]`. Sev B.

**Human hairstyle (Bystedt)**

- Wide and thin clump populations overlap, flyaways are few, and art-directed strands are placed `[00:01:43]`. Sev P.
- Hairline and nape: roots hidden, soft transition (hair cap texture or an extra system) (Bystedt g_ZIOafq4QU `[00:22:28]`, Matsumoto `[00:40:21]`). Sev P.

## F. Shading and light (Cycles or EEVEE render)

| Highlights                  | stretched along strands, not round blobs; they move plausibly when the light moves (for cards: anisotropy plus tangent) | P   | Matsumoto `[00:11:37]`, `[00:14:20]` |
| Display                     | not Strand in EEVEE (radius invisible); Strip plus subdivisions                                                         | B   | Bystedt `[00:10:23]`                 |
| Sparkle                     | EEVEE strips can sparkle under a grazing rim light (seen in the tests); judge in Cycles or soften the rim               | P   | test observation [added]             |
| Review light                | warm top fill, side key, cool rim, darker bluish world                                                                  | P   | Thommes `[00:17:16]`                 |

| No clipping             | strands inside the body in pose                                                          | B   | Schmidbauer `[00:33:50]` |
| Mesh deformation smooth | harsh mesh folds are amplified ten times in the hair: fix the rig or mesh, not the groom | B   | Schmidbauer `[00:33:50]` |

## H. Cards and tubes (games, EEVEE)

| Check                                       | How / look for                                                                                | Sev | Source                             |

| Roots on the scalp, nothing inside the head | `card_stats`, root-row distance, inside test                                                  | B   | Bystedt `[00:03:59]`, `[00:04:34]` |
| Coverage                                    | textured hair cap underneath; no bald look between cards                                      | B   | Bystedt `[00:22:28]`               |
| Budget and UVs                              | tris vs budget; card U in [0, 0.5], tubes [0, 1]; V root 0 to tip 1                           | B   | Matsumoto `[00:31:27]`             |

## Delivery report (what to hand back)

- Counts: guides, full-density curves and points, card triangles.
- Stack: modifier list with key inputs (`H.get_inputs`).
- `verdict()` output, empty or explained.
- Review sheets: the rest pose, 2 to 3 poses, and a close-up if hero.
- What was **not** verified: brush-only steps the user did, Physics-mode dynamics, render time at final resolution.
