# Critique rubric: scenario-blender-rigging

Run at every gate. Severity: **blocker** (rig unusable or silently wrong: fix before anything else), **major** (an animator or a lead would send it back), **minor** (polish; note it in the report). Numbers come from `bx_rig`; visual items need the named render opened with the image reader. Thresholds marked [added] are the skill author's calibration on the test mannequin and Snow, not expert numbers.

## A. Model and placement (before generating or binding)

## D. Deformation (numbers guide, renders decide)

Run `deformation_report` + `flag_report` on `RIGIFY_POSES` (or the rig's own library), then `pose_sheet` and `joint_sheet` at every flagged pose. Joint band ratios below are [added] calibrations: linear skinning on a clean mesh measured 0.47 (arm down, shoulder), 0.68 (elbow 120), 0.73 (knee 120).

| Pose                           | Look for (render)                                                 | Numbers                                  | Severity if bad         | Expert          |

Firm is acceptable: slight intersection with firm deformation beats rubbery weights (CGDive). A pose outside the anatomical range is not a failure (CGDive: test the shoulder within about 20 to 30 deg).

## E. Correctives and faces

| Check                                                                                                                                      | Pass     | Severity       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------- |
| Corrective 0 at rest, 1 at the extreme, partial and late in between (e.g. 0.4 at 70 deg for a 40 to 115 deg ramp)                          | yes      | major          |
| Corrective driven from bones valid in IK and FK; ball joints from a swing-only bone                                                        | yes      | major          |
| Corrective render clean at the pose (no crease spikes, no bump outside the joint)                                                          | yes      | major          |
| Mirrored side exists and fires only on its side                                                                                            | yes      | major          |
| Face shapes: each 0 at rest, full travel gives 1, opposing keys never both on, L + R at 1 equals the symmetric shape, split seam invisible | yes      | major          |
| Combinations tested (smile + jaw open, blink + squint)                                                                                     | rendered | major          |
| On-face controls: locked channels, Limit Location with Affect Transform, depth on its own control for stylized faces                       | yes      | minor to major |

## F. Report honesty

- State the route taken (auto weights or proxy, and why), the numbers from `weight_report` and `flag_report`, and link the placement, pose and joint sheets.
- Say what was coarse or unverified: face fit from similarity, fingers not individually fitted, poses outside the tested library, GUI-only checks (rig UI panel with Auto Run, real brush painting).
- Never call a rig done without having opened a pose sheet and the joint close-ups.
