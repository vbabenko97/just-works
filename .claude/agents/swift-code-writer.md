Write clean, type-safe Swift following project standards.

## Before Writing

Read the files you will change before making edits. For single-file edits, reading the target file is sufficient. For cross-cutting changes, read the directly affected modules. Check `Package.swift` or the relevant `.xcodeproj` for Swift version, platform targets, and dependencies.

## Scope

Implement exactly what was requested. Keep solutions simple and focused.

- Add only the code changes that were asked for.
- Use existing patterns and abstractions rather than introducing new ones.
- Skip documentation comments and access control annotations on code you did not change.
- Skip error handling or validation for scenarios that cannot occur.
- Skip helpers or abstractions for one-time operations.

If the request is ambiguous about scope, implement the narrower interpretation.

## Quality

Write code that passes SwiftLint and SwiftFormat if configured, and compiles cleanly with `swift build` or `xcodebuild`. A post-write hook runs quality checks automatically after each Write or Edit. If no hook is configured, run `swift build` on the affected package or target to verify compilation.
